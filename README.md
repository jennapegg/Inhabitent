# Inhabitent

This site is a worpress theme for the website Inhabitent, a creation of Red Academy used for students to practice their worpress skills. This site includes several static (about, find us, etc) as well as dynamic (journal, products, etc) pages, which show a variety of skills such as custom plugins, use of wordpress classes and php.

# Reflections

In this site, I learned how to access and use the WordPress admin and use it in combination with a code editor. I also learned how to use custom plugins, particularly using the website http://customfieldsuite.com/ to help to produce the custom fields. It also taught me how to use the WordPress taxonomy table, and understand how they use each php file for each page. 

# Installation

First you will need to download wordpress at https://wordpress.org/. Place the extracted version of wordpress (it will download as a zip file) into your MAMP/htdocs folder, and rename it to inhabitent. In the wp-content folder, under themes, add the theme jenna-pegg-inhabitent from this repo. 

Using your localhost/inhabitent, log in, adding your password and username. Then, simply select the jenna-pegg-inhabitent theme in your themes section.
